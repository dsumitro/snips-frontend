import React, { Component } from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

export default class About extends Component {
  static propTypes = {
    prop: PropTypes
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        We literally only had the word "About" here so thats what I'm putting
        here for now
      </div>
    );
  }
}
